Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nExecutor: A agent for executing code\nfile_surfer: An agent that can handle local files.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request is for the complete list of 2024 Calm Summit speakers.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The complete list of speakers for the 2024 Calm Summit. This information would likely be found on the official Calm Summit website, press releases, or news articles about the event.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- None\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- The 2024 Calm Summit is likely an event focused on topics related to mindfulness, well-being, or personal development, given its name.\n- Previous years' Calm Summit speaker lists may include prominent figures in wellness, meditation, or mental health fields, which could be reflected in the 2024 lineup.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Instruct WebSurfer to search for the official website of the Calm Summit or any recent news articles or press releases that mention the 2024 Calm Summit speakers.\n- Once the relevant page or pages are found, have WebSurfer extract and summarize the list of confirmed speakers for the 2024 Calm Summit.\n- If WebSurfer cannot find the list directly, ask it to check for any upcoming announcements or scheduled release dates for the speaker list.\n- Review the gathered information to ensure its accuracy and completeness.\n", "type": "OrchestrationEvent"}
