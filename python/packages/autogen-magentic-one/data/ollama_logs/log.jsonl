FACTS TO LOOK UP:\n\n* Complete list of speakers for the 2024 Calm Summit\n* Website or official source where this information might be found (e.g., Calm's website, press releases, event listings)\n* Any notable speakers already announced (which could provide a starting point)\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE:\n\n* None apparent\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES:\n\n* The 2024 Calm Summit is likely to be held in the United States or other English-speaking countries, given Calm's global reach and marketing efforts.\n* Some speakers might be previously announced as part of Calm's content creation team, podcast lineup, or expert network.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n* WebSurfer:\n\t+ Search online for \"2024 Calm Summit speakers\" and navigate to results pages\n\t+ Look for official Calm website or event page, and check if speaker list is available (if not, try searching other trusted sources)\n\t+ Attempt to find a webpage with an updated speaker list (if available)\n* Coder:\n\t+ Write a Python script to scrape the webpage containing the speaker list (if found) using BeautifulSoup and requests libraries\n\t+ Use regular expressions or string manipulation to extract speaker names from HTML content\n* Executor:\n\t+ Execute the Python script written by Coder, passing in the URL of the webpage with the speaker list\n* File Surfer: Not needed for this task\n", "type": "OrchestrationEvent"}
